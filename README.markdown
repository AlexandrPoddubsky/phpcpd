phpcpd
======

**phpcpd** is a Copy/Paste Detector (CPD) for PHP code.

The goal of **phpcpd** is not not to replace more sophisticated tools such as [phpcs](http://pear.php.net/PHP_CodeSniffer), [pdepend](http://pdepend.org/), or [phpmd](http://phpmd.org/), but rather to provide an alternative to them when you just need to get a quick overview of duplicated code in a project.

Requirements
------------

* The [tokenizer](http://www.php.net/tokenizer) extension is required.

Usage Example
-------------

    sb@ubuntu phpcpd % ./phpcpd.php /path/to/project
    phpcpd 1.0.0 by Sebastian Bergmann.
